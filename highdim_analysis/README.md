#### High Dimensional Data Analysis

Here focus is on techniques for analyzing, reducing, and clustering data with a large number of features, particularly within the context of Genomics.

1. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: three primary approaches (PCA, MDS, SNE) to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D) while preserving specific properties.
2. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
3. Model Selection (BIC): determine the optimal number of clusters using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
