### Computational Modeling 
 
**Machine learning and bioinformatics workspace**: -- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic images (specifically for cancer datasets) and design new molecular structures for drug discovery. -- Biological Classification & Sequencing: Applying supervised learning models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.) to classify medical data such as breast cancer markers, toxicity in chemical compounds, and single-cell protein annotations. It also includes genomic sequencing analysis specifically for COVID-19.

**Foundational topics in statistics**, statistical inference, modeling, and dimensionality reduction.

**High Dimensional Data Analysis** with focus is on techniques for analyzing, reducing, and clustering data with a large number of features, particularly within the context of Genomics.

**Statistical Learning for Lifesciences** with focus on the application of statistical modeling and machine learning to medical research. We primarily utilize datasets from the "Elements of Statistical Learning" (ESL) to demonstrate predictive analytics and sequence analysis.
